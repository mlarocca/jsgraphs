/**
 * @name vertexCover
 * @description
 * Solve the vertex cover problem using simulated annealing optimization.
 *
 * @param {Graph} graph The (complete) graph for which we need to find the vertex cover.
 * @param {Number} maxSteps The number of evolutionary steps that the population will undergo.
 * @param {Object} options A few optional parameters for the algorithm.
 * @param {Number} options.crossoverChance The probability (as a ratio r, 0 <= r <= 1) that, during each evolutionary step,
 *                                        once selected 2 organisms, a new organism will be created as a crossover of its
 *                                        two parents. Mating between the two parents is randomly selected, otherwise
 *                                        the algorithm will just select one of them to advance to next generation.
 *                                        The choice of the elements for mating is based on tournament selection.
 * @param {Number} options.mutation1Chance The probability that the 1st kind of mutation (flipping a single bit)
 *                                        will be applied.
 * @param {Number} options.populationSize The number of simulated organism that will be used.
 * @param {Boolean} options.verbose If true, prints a summary message at each iteration.
 *
 * @return {Object} A POJO with two fields:
 *  - solution: A bit array, with true for the vertices to be used as vertex cover (not guaranteed to be optimal, nor valid);
 *  - cost: The size of the vertex cover found, if the solution is a valid vertex cover; a weighted sum including a term
 *          for the edges that aren't covered, otherwise.
